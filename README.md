DATABASE SYSTEM AND SPREADSHEET SHORT INFO:

A spreadsheet is a file that contains tabular data – textual and numeric data arranged in rows and columns.
The most famous spreadsheet apps today are Microsoft Excel and Google Sheets.
Spreadsheets have lots of usage from basic mathematical calculations to complex business analysis.
Each spreadsheets have own data storage capacity. However, if more data than the capacity should be store, then we need to more advanced system whis truly is databases.
A database is a system that stores the data arranged in tables with rows and columns.(Sometimes rows can be refered as records and columns as fields.
The software to create a database and manipulate data in it is called a database management system (DBMS).
It is an interface that allows users to query data, manage tables, and perform other data manipulations within the database.

WHY WE NEED A DBMS INSTEAD OF SPREADSHEETS:

The only similarities of between them is they both can store the data as tabular format.
They both are collection of tables. However, databases can store huge numbers compared to the spreadsheets.
This is the main difference between them and advantage of databases.
As it said before, spreadsheets have a limit to store data, but databases don’t have any issiue related to the data volume limitations.
Spreadsheets have poor performance with large volumes of data.
Consistency and integrity of the data denote the rules that ensure validity and accuracy of the data in the database.
These rules includes unique column names, primary key values etc. You can’t delete any rows that have a connection with other tables.
That is another difference of the databases from spreadsheets.
Databases validates the date you enter and can reject it if it doesn’t correspond the type of other data in the column.
This is actually an advantage, because it saves you from typos and errors. You can also set up validation in some spreadsheet apps.
However, you will still be able to enter wrong data and you will get a warning about this.
Document databases can also allow you to enter any type of value.
At the same time, you can set up the database structure in a way that will make it impossible to input wrong values.
   The file based data management systems contained multiple files that were stored in many different locations in a system or even across multiple systems.
Because of this, there were sometimes multiple copies of the same file which lead to data redundancy.
Databases prevents redundancy and makes the best possible usage of the storage.
For example, if  the same product gets entered twice by mistake, data redundancy takes place and it will reduce the chance of destructive anomalies appearing.
  Data Sharing is the primary advantage of Database management systems. It let multiple users access and edit data.
DBMS system allows users and applications to share Data with multiple applications and users.
DBMSs keep logs of every change, which maintains the integrity and consistency of the data. Spreadsheets have also limited sharibility.
   Data security which is another important thing is also provided by database management systems.
As number of users increases data transferring or data sharing rate also increases thus increasing the risk of data security.
Lots of company invest money, time and effort in large amount to ensure data is secure and is used properly.
DBMS provides a better platform to privacy and security.
    Scalability is another advantages of databases. It refers to capability of a system to handle a growing.
A system is said to be scalable if it can increase its workload and throughput when additional resources are added.
A scalable system can be changed to adapt to changing workloads without impacting its accessibility, thereby assuring continuing availability even as modifications are made.
DBMS automatically takes care of recovery and backup. The users do not need to take back up periodically, because it is taken care of by  DBMS.
It also restores a database after a system failure or crash to prevent its previous condition.

    If we should get real life correspondence of usage od databases, we can give  example like these.
    
    On social media sites, people can create accounts and chat with each other. They can exchange music, pictures, data and have discussions.
 Just like any other website that accepts and produces data, a social media website has a database where this information is stored.
 They use highly reliable and capable database software.
 
    Predicting weather is very complex. The weather organizations use prediction model which includes various informations that gathered, stored and analyzed within databases.
These databases allow the data always be accessible and easily deliverable.

    Any online company that sells something such as amazon, trendyol etc. uses databases which help pricing, organize products, information about products, purchasing history.
    
   The Goverment always stores our data and uses databases at many different platforms such as e-devlet,e-nabız,Hayatevesığar etc. for various reasons such as legislation, defence,  humanitarian aims. 
Since, these informations are so sensitive, The Goverment are often looking for a database that is designed to handle data as safely as possible.
